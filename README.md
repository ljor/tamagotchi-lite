# tamagotchi-lite

Welcome to Tamagotchi-Lite

The goal of the game is to keep your pet alive until it dies of old age (at 35)
Keep its hunger, sleepiness, and boredom levels below 10. If any of those reach 10, your pet wil die.

Have fun!



-------------- Improvment Ideas --------------

Gameplay:

- sound effects on feed/sleep/play button clicks
- eating/sleeping/playing animations
- entering name also works with a press of the enter button on a keyboard
- add feedback on why pet died (starved, lack of sleep, etc.)
- winning game condition
- slow down timers (they don't need to tick so fast anymore)

Display/Graphics:
- more flexible display for multiple devices
- add a fun background
- improve button appearance
- add some more little pets to randomize
